About this Visualization

This visualization uses the drill-down structure to tell the story of Night Light Output of India.  Built on scenes following a template of visual consistency, with various annotations, parameters and some triggers. The visualization structure is easy to navigate using dropdowns, inputs, checkbox and button and provides the viewer a way to transition to other scenes. A brief summary is provided to help user understand the displayed data and navigate.

ABOUT THE DATASET

The dataset could be found through India Night Lights, which contains all the data of India at the state and district level, from year 1993 to 2013. This visualization mainly talks about the light consumption in India from 1993 to 2013. I am interested in finding out which states show the highest consumption during the night in India and then further explore it at the district level and specific date range. The India Lights API provides the data at convenient endpoints that allows you to look at specific time intervals and administration levels. The original data set comes in the form of nightly images from the DMSP satellites, available as TIF files from NOAA. This API is powered by monthly summaries of the light output of 600,000 villages, extracted from those TIFs. There are further use cases available using the data such as progress of electrification of villages in India over the years.
